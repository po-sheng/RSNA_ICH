# Introduction
This is the homework of Digital Medicine coarse. Trying to detect RSNA intracranial Hemorrhage Detection task. 
Including "Epidural", "Subdural", "Subarachnoid", "Intraventricular", and "Intraparenchymal"

# Usage
Put the dataset in 'dataset/raw/' and run 'script/histogram' to split train and val set

To train our model:
    1. First move into 'model/' directory
    2. Second modify the GPU setting in 'train.py'
    3. Last, run our code by simple command 'python3 train.py'

    You can see checkpoint in 'model/checkpoint/' and also some analysis base on result in 'model/result/'

To predict using our model:
    1. First move into 'model/' directory
    2. Second modify the GPU setting in 'train.py'
    3. Last, run our code by simple command 'python3 predict.py'

    You will get the result csv file in 'model/'

There are also some useful script in 'script/':
    analysis.py:
        Read .dcm image and read its value

    refine_anls.py:
        Read .dcm image and use window center and window width to normalize image

    histogram.py:
        Show the histogram of an image

    train_test_split.py:
        split the original dataset to train and val set
